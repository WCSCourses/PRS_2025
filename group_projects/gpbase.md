# Group Projects

## Background

You have just completed the Wellcome Connecting Science PRS course and are now acquainted with tools such as PRSice, PRSCSx, and BRIDGEPRS, which claim to improve PRS prediction in Africans. You are now getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools to test out and do not know which tool to use for your PRS project, which involves continental Africans. You decide to read more, and you then stumble across a novel approach called PRSmix (shown below) by Troung et al.(2024), which integrates PRSs developed using diverse methods, forming an integrated PRS that has been noted to outperform previously reported PRS, as shown below. This seems as a much more pragmatic approach, and you are eager to apply it to your PRS projects.

## Questions
Qn1. Do you think the PRSmix approach will predict well in continental Africans? Discuss?<br>
Qn2. What metrics will you use to evaluate the predictivity of the PRS for the trait you have been assigned?<br>
Qn3. May you outline the steps and sample code you will use to apply the PRSmix approach to the trait you have been assigned?<br> 
Qn4. Apply you analysis plan in Qn3 and determine the predictivity of the intergrated PRS using the PRSmix approach.<br>

## Analytical datasets
 **Group 1** Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/hba1cdta.txt<br> 
 **Group 2** Insulin reistance (HOMA_IR) https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/homairdta.txt<br>
 **Group 3** OGTT 2hr glucose https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/2hrglcdta.txt<br> 
 **Group 4** Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/satdta.txt<br>

 ## Milestones to guide with project completion
 **1.** Assign tasks and roles to group members to tackle the project ensuring the tasks can be completed in parallel.<br>
 **2.** Ensure you complete Qn 1 and Qn 2 by Wednesday as these do not require  data analysis.<br>
 **3.** You need to write up and finalise the analysis plan by Thursday.<br>
 **4.** Run the analysis and finalise your work for presentation on Friday.<br>

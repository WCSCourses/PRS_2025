## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

Our group project focuses on exploring the predictive performance of various polygenic scores (PGS) for glycemic traits, particularly **HbA1c**, 
using data gotten from Polygenic scores (PGS) catalog compared with the performance of PRSmix.

We evaluate:
- The performance of **combined vs individual PGS** using PRSmix
- Adjustments for covariates such as age, sex, and population structure (PCs)

This project primarily uses **R** (â‰¥ 4.2.0). Key packages include:

- `ggplot2`
- `glmnet`
- `caret`
- `tidyverse`
- `skimr`
- `recipes`
